In this project, I’ll build a demand forecasting pipeline that combines historical rental counts with weather and time-of-day features to predict hourly bike-sharing usage. I’ll implement and compare several machine learning and data mining algorithms, such as linear regression, SVM, gradient boosting, and XGBoost, using cross-validation. Finally, I’ll evaluate each model (RMSE, MAE) and analyze feature importances to guide dynamic bike redistribution.
