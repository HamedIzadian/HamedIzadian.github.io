In this project, I’ll build a demand forecasting pipeline that combines historical rental counts with weather and time-of-day features to predict hourly bike-sharing usage. I’ll implement and compare several machine learning and data mining algorithms, such as linear regression, SVM, gradient boosting, and XGBoost, using cross-validation. Finally, I’ll evaluate each model (RMSE, MAE) and analyze feature importances to guide dynamic bike redistribution.

In this project, I aim to learn and teach at the same time. That's why I started this project: to learn new things and share what I've learned, so it can be helpful to someone else. At the end, I will share all the resources I've used to complete this project.

## 1- Project Overview

Now, let’s briefly explain our problem and how this prediction can help businesses increase their efficiency and profitability. In recent years, many businesses have sought to improve public transportation through bike-sharing systems. It is crucial for them to understand their future demand so they can make better decisions that lead to increased profits. Some costs, such as maintenance and establishing parking lots for bikes, can become significantly high if there is an excess of available bikes. Conversely, having a shortage of available bikes compared to demand can result in a revenue loss, making it essential to accurately predict bike-sharing demand.
