I am Hamed, a master's student in Industrial Engineering at Kharazmi University. After completing all my coursework, I am working on my thesis and a research paper. My main research interests are supply chain management, optimization under uncertainty, and machine learning. I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in these fields. Additionally, I am strongly interested in non-convex optimization, discrete optimization, machine learning for operations research (ML/OR), and data mining. I am eager to connect with researchers and professors to contribute to advancing knowledge in these domains.
