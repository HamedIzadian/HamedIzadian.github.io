In this study, we propose a bi-objective optimization model for a closed-loop supply chain that considers imperfect quality production at the manufacturing stage and accounts for potential inspection errors at distribution centers. The model explicitly incorporates on-time delivery constraints through specified time windows, allowing for the strategic selection of vehicles that simultaneously minimize operational costs and environmental impacts. To address the multi-objective nature of the problem, we employed two established solution methods—the LP-metric method and the Min-Max method—and subsequently evaluated their performance through the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to validate the robustness and practical applicability of the proposed model under varying operational conditions.
